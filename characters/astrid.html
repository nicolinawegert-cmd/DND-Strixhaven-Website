            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <div class="parchment">
              <p>
                Astrid’s story began not on the stormy isle of Svellheim, but deep within the enchanted forests of an elven kingdom. As a child she roamed those woods with boundless curiosity, playing with animals and learning the secrets of the wild. That life was torn away when raiders struck her village. In the chaos, her mother fled with Astrid in her arms, grievously wounded and on the edge of death. She carried her daughter across the sea to Svellheim, where she vanished from Astrid’s life—leaving behind only fragments of memory that now return to Astrid in visions she struggles to believe are truly her own.              
              </p>
              <p>
                On Svellheim, Astrid was found by Ulf Isulv, the Wolf clan’s chieftain and also King of Svellheim. Though he saw an elf, he also saw a fire in her eyes—resilience, strength, and the spirit of a warrior. Ulf claimed her as his daughter, raising her among the clan. Astrid grew into a hunter, warrior, and shieldmaiden, fighting with the ferocity of her adoptive people. The clan came to love her, but Astrid never felt she truly belonged. The Isulv worshiped the gods of storm and war, while Astrid’s heart was bound to the spirits of nature, the moon, and the wolf, who she felt were her true kin.

                It was in this bond with the wild that Astrid found her calling as a druid. She walked a path balanced between her Viking upbringing and her elven heritage—defending her clan fiercely, yet always feeling that her destiny stretched beyond the sea and the longships. Where the Wolf clan sought to conquer nature, Astrid sought to protect it. That difference set her apart, a constant reminder of roots half-remembered and never fully lost.

                When the invitation to study at Strixhaven reached her, Astrid knew it was more than coincidence—it was a sign. Leaving Svellheim meant turning her back on the only family she had ever known, but it was also the chance to embrace her full self: not wholly elf, not wholly Viking, but something greater. With a heavy heart, she departed, carrying with her the wolf’s spirit, the weight of her clan’s pride, and the burning need to uncover the truth of who she truly is.
