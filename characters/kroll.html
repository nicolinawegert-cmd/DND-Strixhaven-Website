                Tulpdam, once the capital of Riverien and jewel of Laagland, was a city of beauty, art, and invention. Yet tragedy struck the Werk family there. Kroll Locke Werk was born frail and cursed — his first breath took his mother’s life, and his heart was weak, perhaps never truly his own but bound to the spirit of Aradar Nightstar. His father, Locke Oranje Werk, a widowed artificer, devoted everything to saving him, but no healer or spell could fix a heart not meant to beat.

                Kroll grew up in constant pain but forced himself to endure for his father’s sake, training until suffering became his rhythm. He found solace in craftwork, his nimble hands turning to gears and brass rather than play or companionship. The outside world, however, scorned the Werk name. Their half-elven blood and distant ties to the royal van Oranje line made them fodder for slander, especially in contrast to their celebrated cousin, Eustace van Oranje — a brilliant, arrogant prodigy praised as the “Star of Laagland.”

                As rumors and insults grew unbearable, Locke moved the family into exile in Scardale, far from tulips and light. There, Kroll secretly apprenticed under an aging artificer, adopting the alias “John Smith.” Though only a boy, his precision and intellect soon made him indispensable. To honor his father, he began crafting a golden pocket watch — a gift born of love.

                But the finished watch awakened something strange. Kroll’s lifelong pain eased when it was near, though whispers haunted him in its ticking. Time itself seemed to ripple, and his eyes transformed into living clock faces. Realizing the artifact bound him to something greater and more terrible, Kroll resolved to uncover the truth of his cursed heart and the spirit within.

                Now, with his family’s name in disgrace and the weight of time upon him, Kroll dreams of studying at Strixhaven. There, he hopes to find not only answers to his condition but also what he has never truly known: friendship, belonging, and peace.
