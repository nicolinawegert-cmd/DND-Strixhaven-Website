        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>
          Tsimo The Tsimo is a halfling bard who grew up in a small village known for its vibrant music scene. From a young age, Tsimo showed a natural talent for music and storytelling, often entertaining the villagers with tales of heroism and adventure. As he grew older, Tsimo felt a calling to explore the world beyond his village and share his music with a wider audience. He enrolled at Strixhaven to hone his skills and learn new magical techniques to enhance his performances.
